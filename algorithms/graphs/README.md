# Overview
A graph is a data structure to represent relationships, or connections between elements.
It consists of:
* Nodes (Vertices) - the entities in the graph
* Edges (Links) - the connections between nodes

Graphs can be:
* Directed - edges have one way connection (A -> B)
* Undirected - edges are bidirectional (A <-> B)

They also can be:
* Weighted - edges have a weight / cost (e.g. distance, time)
* Unweighted - all edges are equal
