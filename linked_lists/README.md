# Overview
Linked Lists are an ordered collection of objects.
Each element of a Linked List is called a **node**.
Each **node** contains at least 2 fields:
* **data** - data that needs to be stored in the **node**
* **next** - reference to the next **node** on the list

## Section information

Most of the operations presented in this section will be performed based on the [linked_list_node.py](/linked_lists/linked_list_node.py) file, and the objects defined there.

Currently covered operations are:
* Reverse linked list: [`reverse_linked_list.py`](/linked_lists/reverse_linked_list.py)
* Detect cycle: [`detect_cycle.py`](/linked_lists/detect_cycle.py)
* Merge Two Sorted Linked Lists: [`merge_sorted_lists.py`](/linked_lists/merge_sorted_lists.py)
